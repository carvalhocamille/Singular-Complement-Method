# Singular-Complement-Method
FEM to solve scattering problem using P2 Lagrange FE, and with Singular
Complement Method (SCM)
The problem solved is the following:
|  div(1/eps Grad u)+ mu u = 0,        in D,
|                     u = f,                 on B, 
where D is a disk composed of 2 materials characterized by
eps and mu: these parameters can change sign

This code uses a .msh mesh generated by GMSH that dictates the geoemtry
The code is organized as follows:
1) Define parameters 
2) Read mesh. We use lecture_msh_P2.m to extract information from the .msh
3) Assemble FE matrices. We use matrix_assembly.m to assemble mass, stiffness, and surface matrices
4) Build right hand side and solve with Standard FEM
5) Build the SCM: solve the linear system to compute the singular complement 
       We use cutoff.m to define the cutoff function,
              singular_expression.m to compute the analytic terms involving the singularity
              NCQ.m to compute the coupling terms via Newton-Cotes
              Quadrature rule
6) Compute the singularity coefficient (b)
7) Solve the problem using SCM
8) save and post-process the results
